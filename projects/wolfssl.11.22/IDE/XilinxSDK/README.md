# Common Gotcha's

- If compiling all code together (ie no separate wolfssl library) then the -fPIC compiler flag should be used. Without using -fPIC in this build setup there could be unexpected failures.
- If building with ARMv8 crypto extensions then the compiler flags "-mstrict-align -mcpu=generic+crypto" must be used.
- Check that enough stack and heap memory is set for the operations if a crash or stall happens.

# Xilinx SDK wolfCrypt Vitis 2018.2 Project

To use this example project:
1. Start a new workspace
2. Create a new BSP called `standalone_bsp_0`.
3. Copy `.cproject` and `.project` from IDE/XilinxSDK/2018_2 into the wolfSSL root.
4. From the Xilinx SDK Import wolfBoot using "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace".


# Detailed Instructions For Example Use With Vitis 2019.2

1. Create a new workspace located in the directory wolfssl/IDE/XilinxSDK/2019_2
2. Create a new BSP, by selecting;
   - File->New->Platform Project
   - Setting "Project name" to standalone_bsp_0, then click "Next"
   - Select the "Create from hardware specification" radius and click "Next"
   - "Browse..." to the desired XSA file for the hardware
   - (optional) change Processor to R5 now
   - click "Finish"
3. (optional) If building for TLS support than expand the standalone_bsp_0 project, double click on platform_spr, Expand the cpu (i.e psu_cortexa53_0), click on Board Support Package, select the "Modify BSP Settings..." box and click on lwip211. Note that the api_mode should be changed from RAW API to SOCKET API.
4. Right click on the standalone_bsp_0 project and click on "Build Project"
5. Import the wolfcrypt example project "File->Import->Eclipse workspace or zip file"
6. Uncheck "Copy projects into workspace"
7. Select the root directory of `wolfssl/IDE/XilinxSDK/2019_2`, and select `wolfCrypt_example` and `wolfCrypt_example_system`. Then click "Finish"


# Detailed Instructions For Example Use With Vitis 2022.1

This shows the necessary steps on the basis of using the VMK180 development board.

1. Create a new workspace located in the directory `wolfssl/IDE/XilinxSDK/2022_1`.
2. Create a new platform project.
   - On the welcome screen select "Create platform project".
   - Give it a good name, e.g. `vmk180` and click 'Next'.
   - In the Hardware Specification drop-down menu select "vmk180" and click 'Finish'.
3. Enable the necessary libraries in the bsp.
   - Open `platform.spr` in the 'vmk180' platform project.
   - In the tree-view select "Board Support Package" and click on "Modify BSP Settings...".
   - Enable the `xilmailbox` and `xilsecure` libraries.
   - In this tree-view on the left side under "Overview->standalone" appeared now a "xilsecure" entry.
   - Select "xilsecure" and change the configuration of `cache_disable` to `false`. Press 'OK' to confirm the change.
   - Build the platform project, either via "Project->Build All" or by the keyboard shortcut 'CTRL+b'.
4. Import the wolfcrypt example projects "File->Import->Eclipse workspace or zip file".
   - Behind 'Select Root directory' click on 'Browse...'. You should already be in the correct directory, but still make sure that you're in `wolfssl/IDE/XilinxSDK/2022_1/`. Click 'Open'.
   - Uncheck "Copy projects into workspace".
   - Select the two example projects `wolfCrypt_example` and `wolfCrypt_example_system`, then click 'Finish'.
5. Fix the missing link from platform project and system project.
   - In the 'Explorer' Window open the `wolfCrypt_example_system` and double-click `wolfCrypt_example_system.prj`.
   - You should normally see a pop-up with the title "Platform invalid". Click on "Change referred platform", select your platform and click 'OK'.
   - In case you didn't see the pop-up, you should see the 'System Project Settings'. Click on the `...` behind 'Platform', select your platform and click 'OK'.
   - Vitis will now remind you that all build configurations will be cleaned, click 'Yes'.
6. Create a new linker script
   - In the 'Explorer' Window open the `wolfCrypt_example_system` and right-click on the `wolfCrypt_example` project. Click 'Generate Linker Script'.
   - Configure the memory sections you want to use, the default should be OK for this example.
   - 'Heap Size' must be increased according to your use case. For this example to run it is sufficient to increase to `8 MB`. For benchmarks with big chunk sizes increase to `512 MB`.
   - Increase 'Stack Size' to `32 KB`.
   - Click 'Generate'

## FreeRTOS based example projects

1. In the previously created `vmk180` platform, one can see a tree where you can also find the "Board support package" settings.
   - Click on the bold green `+` on the top to 'Add Domain'.
   - Give the new domain the name "freertos" and change the "OS" in the drop-down menu to "freertos".
2. Repeat the same steps of the previous step 3 for the newly created domain.
   - In the tree-view select "freertos10_xilinx" and then open the "kernel_behavior" sub-entry.
   - Change `minimal_stack_size` to `8000`, `tick_rate` to `1000` and `total_heap_size` to `8388608`. "Big chunk sizes" have not been tested under FreeRTOS.
3. Repeat the same steps of the previous steps 4 to 6, but with the `wolfCrypt_FreeRTOS_example` resp. `wolfCrypt_FreeRTOS_example_system`.


## Troubleshooting

* `make: *** No rule to make target '../src/lscript.ld', needed by 'wolfCrypt_example.elf'.  Stop.`: You forgot to create the linker script
* `/path/to/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/port/xilinx/xil-versal-glue.h:30:10: fatal error: xsecure_mailbox.h: No such file or directory`: You forgot to add the `xilmailbox` and/or `xilsecure` libraries.
* `/path/to/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/src/port/xilinx/xil-aesgcm.c:90: undefined reference to 'Secure_AesInitialize'` (and others): You forgot to build the platform project after adding the libraries.

## Code formatter

In case one wants to write code in "wolfSSL style" in Vitis:
   - go to "Window->Preferences->Additional->C/C++->Code Style->Formatter".
   - Click on 'Import', navigate to `wolfssl/IDE/XilinxSDK/` and select the file `eclipse_formatter_profile.xml`, click on 'Apply and Close'.

## Configuration

All configuration is done through the header file in `wolfssl/IDE/XilinxSDK/user_settings.h`

### Build flavors

Define `WOLFSSL_XILINX_CRYPT` to enable the **crypto engines**. (This is the default)

Undefine `WOLFSSL_XILINX_CRYPT` and define `WOLFSSL_ARMASM` to enable the **ARMv8 Cryptographic Extensions**.

Undefine both `WOLFSSL_XILINX_CRYPT` and `WOLFSSL_ARMASM` to enable a **software-only build**.

### Further features

Define `WC_XIL_AESGCM_DPA_CM` to enable Counter Measures for Differential Power Analysis of the AES-GCM core. (Only available when using the crypto engines).

Undefine `HAVE_HASHDRBG` to enable usage of the DRBG in the crypto engine.

Define `WOLFSSL_ECDSA_DETERMINISTIC_K` to use "deterministic K" as of RFC6979. (Supported for all three build flavors).

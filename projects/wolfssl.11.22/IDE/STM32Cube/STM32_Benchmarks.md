## STM32U585

Supports RNG, AES CBC/GCM and SHA-1,SHA-2 acceleration.

Board: B-U585I-IOT02A
CPU: Cortex-M33 at 160 MHz
IDE: STM32CubeIDE
RTOS: FreeRTOS

### STM32U585 (STM Symmetric AES/SHA acceleration, STM PKA PKA w/Fast Math)

This test uses `WOLFSSL_SMALL_STACK_CACHE`, which slightly improves the DRBG RNG performance.

Only the ECC sign and verify are currently being accelerated by PKA.

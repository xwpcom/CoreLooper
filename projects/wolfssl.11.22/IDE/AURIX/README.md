# Infineon AURIX Development Studio

An Eclipse based IDE for developing software for the Infineon TriCore AURIX TX3XX.

Tested Platform:
* Infineon AURIXâ„¢ Development Studio 1.7.2 (Build 20220617-0730)
* Infineon TriBoard TC399 v2.0
* wolfSSL v5.4.0 (with PR 5419)

## Running wolfCrypt on TriCore

1) Add the wolfSSL source and headers to `Libraries/wolfssl`. 
  - Only the following folders are required: `src`, `wolfcrypt` and `wolfssl`.
  - See script to help with producing bundle here: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/scripts/makedistsmall.sh
2) Add `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS` to the Preprocessing symbols list. C/C++ Build -> Settings -> TASKING C/C++ Compiler -> Preprocessing.
3) Add `Libraries/wolfssl` to the include path. C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols -> Includes -> GNU C
4) Add ignores for the following warnings. Unused static function (553) and switch missing break (536). C/C++ Build -> Settings -> TASKING C/C++ Compiler -> Diagnostics
5) Copy `Cpu0_Main.c`, `user_settings.h` and `wolf_main.c` into the project folder.
6) Increase the stack by modifying `Lcf_Tasking_Tricore_Tc.lsl` to adjusting the USTACK0-4 (`LCF_USTACK#_SIZE`) from 2k to 12k.
6) Build and run/debug.

### Example output from wolfCrypt test and benchmark

Benchmark Configuration:
* TriCore (TC1.6.2P) 32-bit super-scalar running at 300MHz:
* Release build: `-O2`
* SP Math SMALL: sp_c32.c for RSA/ECC/DH
* AES GCM SMALL

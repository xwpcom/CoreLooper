wolfSSL for Renesas RZN2L Board
=================================================

## Description

This directory contains e2studio projects targeted at the Renesas RZ MCUs.
The example projects include a wolfSSL TLS client and server.
They also include benchmark and cryptography tests for the wolfCrypt library.

The example project contains both the wolfSSL and wolfCrypt libraries.
It is built as a `Renesas RZ/N C/C++ FSP Project` and contains the Renesas RZ
configuration. The wolfssl project uses `Renesas Secure IP on RZ`
as hardware acceleration for cyptography.

**Limitation**

Due to lacking of TLS related feature on RSIP driver version, TLS connection examples below use `SHA` and `Random generation` of RSIP driver.

The example project summary is listed below and is relevant for every project.

## Setup Steps and Build wolfSSL Library

1.) Import  projects from [File]->[Open projects from File System]

+ Select folder at /path/to/wolfssl/IDE/Renesas/e2studio/RZN2L/test

2.) Create a `dummy_application` Renesas RZ/N C/C++ FSP Project.

+ Click File->New->`RZ/N C/C++ FSP Project`.
+ Enter project name `dummy_application`.
+ Select Board: to `RSK+RZN2L (RAM execution without flash memory)`.
+ Select Device: to `R9A07G084M04GBG`. Click Next.
+ Check to `Executable`
+ Select FreeRTOS from RTOS selection. Click Finish.
+ Check `FreeRTOS minimal - Static Allocation`. Click Finish.
+ Open FSP Configurator by clicking configuration.xml in the project -->
+ Go to `Stacks` tab
+ Add new thread by clicking `New Thread`, and set properties below

|Property|Value|
|:--|:--|
|Thread Symbol|rzn2l_tst_thread|
|Thread Name|rzn2l_tst_thread|
|Thread Stack size|increase depending on your environment<br> e.g. 0xA000|
|Thread MemoryAllocation|Dyamic|
|Common General Use Mutexes|Enabled|
|Common General Enable Backward Compatibility|Enabled|
|Common Memory Allocation Support Dynamic Allocation|Enabled|
|Common Memory Allocation Total Heap Size|increase depending on your environment<br> e.g. 0x20000|

+ Add `Heap 4` stack to rzn2l_tst_thread from `New Stack` -> `FreeRTOS` -> `FreeRTOS Heap 4`
+ Add `UART Driver` stack to rzn2l_tst_thread from `New Stack` -> `Connectivity` -> `UART Driver`
+ Add `FreeRTOS + TCP` stack to rzn2l_tst_thread from `New Stack` -> -> `FreeRTOS` -> `Libraries` -> `FreeRTOS+TCP` and set properties

+ Save `dummy_application` FSP configuration
+ Copy <u>configuration.xml</u> under `dummy_application` to `test_RZN2L`
+ Open FSP configuration by clicking copied configuration.xml at `test_RZN2L`
+ Click `Generate Project Content` on FSP configuration GUI

3.) Prepare UART to logging

+ Download Sample package from [BACnet Start-Up](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rz-mpus/bacnet-start-rzn2l-rsk)
+ Copy the following C source files from the project to src/serial_io folder of `test_RZN2L`
      + um_serial_io_uart.c
      + um_serial_io_task_writer.c
      + um_serial_io_cfg.h
      + um_common_api.h
      + um_common_cfg.h
      + um_serial_io.c
      + um_serial_io.h
      + um_serial_io_api.h
      + um_serial_io_internal.h

3.) Build `test_RZN2L` project

## Run `test_RZN2L`

1). Right click the project and Select menu `Debug` -> `Renesas GDB Hardware debugging`

2). Select J-Link ARM and R9A07G084M04

Description: wolfSSL encryption library
 The wolfSSL embedded SSL library (formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS
 library written in ANSI C and targeted for embedded, RTOS, and
 resource-constrained environments - primarily because of its small size, speed,
 and feature set. It is commonly used in standard operating environments as well
 because of its royalty-free pricing and excellent cross platform support.
 wolfSSL supports industry standards up to the current TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3
 levels.
